      <h4>Sustainable Development Goals</h4>
      <p>
        In 2015, countries adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
        and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals. In 2016, the Paris Agreement
        on climate change entered into force, addressing the need to limit the
        rise of global temperatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Governments, businesses, and civil society together with the United
        Nations are mobilizing efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development
        Agenda by 2030. Universal, inclusive, and indivisible, the Agenda calls
        for action by all countries to improve the lives of people 
        everywhere.
