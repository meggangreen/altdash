  <p>The World Bank Group is a unique global partnership: five institutions 
     working for sustainable solutions that reduce poverty and build shared 
     prosperity in developing countries. 
  <p>It consists of 189 member countries, staff from more than 170 countries, 
     and offices in more than 130 locations. It works in every major area of 
     development, providing an array of financial products and technical 
     assistance, and helping countries share and apply innovative knowledge and 
     solutions to the challenges they face.</p>
  <p>One of the ways The World Bank achieves its goals is through data 
     collection and analysis. The data is freely available online as part of an
     Open Data initiative. All data on AltDash was downloaded from the <a 
     href="https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog" target="_blank" title="World 
     Bank Data Catalog">Data Catalog</a> and not modified other than to 
     facilitate the AltDash database functionality.
